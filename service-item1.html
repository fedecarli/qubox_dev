                    </div>
                    <p class="wow fadeInRight animated">The trading environment of B3 is the Puma Trading System. Market data is distributed by the UMDF (Unified Market Data Feed) platform, which is responsible for the real-time distribution of all bid and business data being realized in all B3 markets. The data is broadcast in Multicast and based on UDP. These messages are encoded with FAST (FIX Adapted for Streaming) compression to optimize bandwidth consumption, in other words, designed to enhance the electronic exchange of financial data, particularly for the dissemination of high-volume and low-latency data.<br><br>

                        The ENTRY POINT is where negotiation sessions, order management and TCP Recovery (historical replay) are established, and the exchange of messages occurs through the TCP procedure, where there must be confirmation of the receipt of the data. After the connection the exchanged messages are coded according to the FIX (Financial Information Exchange) protocol, which is a messaging pattern for the real-time electronic exchange of securities and asset transactions.<br><br>
                        
                        The financial market currently requires applications to be capable of processing and analyzing large volumes of data at high speed, requiring ultra-low latency technologies. To meet these challenges, we have developed our solutions based in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), enabling high performance fullfilment, close to that achieved with ASICs devices solutions, while maintaining the typical flexibility of software implementation, providing a wide range of simultaneous resources in reconfigurable hardware to process critical tasks on the stock exchange.<br><br>
                        
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/images/IMAGENS/PLACA FINANCIAL PG.png" class="wow fadeInRight animated" style="width: 70vw; height: auto; max-width: 800px;"><br><br><br>
                    <p class="wow fadeInRight animated">Our team works with software and hardware engineers, who together develop integrated solutions with the goal of delivering performance that only custom solutions can achieve. Our application includes the capacity to dynamically manage packet processing, taking advantage of hardware parallelism and adjusting the constant change of security algorithms. Each new generation of FPGA technologies, we use this experience and expertise to expand the boundaries and develop products with better performance, while maintaining the high level of reliability required in critical operations.<br><br>

                        In addition, reducing the delay between the arrival of market data and the issuance of an order is fundamental in high frequency negotiations and in these conditions all events are treated on the nanosecond scale, which is essentially impossible to obtain in software, of luck that having the best technology dedicated to such a scenario is critical to gaining a great competitive advantage in the form of latency arbitrage.<br><br>
                        
                        Our solution achieves extremely low latency operating in real and highly deterministic time. In practical terms, this means having the confidence and certainty of receiving the same latency in every business, regardless of market conditions. There is no oscillation in response time when we use our custom FPGA functionality, since hardware-based analysis does not use an operating system, besides that the process is dedicated to the operation that must be performed and is not subject to periodic interruptions by other system processes.<br><br>

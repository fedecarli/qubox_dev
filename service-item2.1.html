                    </div>
                    <p class="wow fadeInRight animated">Blockchain promises to revolutionize what we mean by value. In a short time the financial system will be unrecognizable, allowing you to transact, create and exchange value, providing an alternative to the authentication of a powerful institution, in other words, without the traditional financial agents acting as intermediaries. The financial services industry has been using a new terminology for Blockchain, namely, Distributive Accounting Technology, because of its safety, speed and cost qualities.<br><br>

                    We believe that Blockchain is the most disruptive innovation in the history of computing, a distributed database, in which trust is established through mass collaboration and tamper-proof. Blockchain&#39;s distributive power is a system where no single point gaining control, the set of network nodes agrees with the order in which blocks of transactions are being aggregated to the block chain; therefore decentralized. A platform that ensures trust in the transactions and keeps the information recorded regardless of the counterparty&#39;s performance. Blockchain is a digitized, decentralized public record where all nodes own and maintain a replica of the record of the transactions effected, materialized in the form of a distributed ledger, which can not be edited or deleted, but at any time, can be verified and audited.<br><br>
                    
                    In Blockchain a consensus system is created, where the ownership of each currency in circulation is confirmed; although "currency" is only one of the possibilities of trading in Blockchain; so when a transaction is included in a block, there is a guarantee that no previous or future transactions will spend the same currency, avoiding duplicate spending and also confirming the ownership of each currency or asset in circulation. To achieve consensus, the network uses a mechanism called PoW (Proof of Work) where participants agree that the first who solve a puzzle or cryptographic challenge, can create the next block. This block contains all transactions registered chronologically. This whole process of election and validation is the key to the success of the "decentralized" consensus. <br><br>
                    
                    The puzzle or cryptographic challenge is a Poisson process taking on average 10 minutes to find the solution and is mathematically configured to make it impossible to find shortcuts. Participants called "miners" have to spend resources such as computing equipment and electricity, to solve the puzzle and find the next hash. Miners collect all the pending transactions that they find on the network and rotate the data through a compiled encryption function called the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256). Finding the correct value of this hash is very difficult and if the value is wrong, it makes a small adjustment to the data entry and tries again. So each attempt results in an entirely different hash value. <br><br>
                    
                    The currency generation is proposed through an resourceful mechanism; there is no Federal Reserve, nor Central Bank or Treasury with control over the currency. It was established that the difficulty of mining the currency will increase every two weeks. Then 1 block every 10 minutes, 6 blocks per hour, 144 per day, 1008 per week, every 2016 blocks in 2 weeks the difficulty is adjusted. (2016 x 2 = 4032 / month x 12 = 48,384 / year x 4.3 years ~ 210,000 blocks. It was agreed that for every 210,000 blocks, on average every 4 years, the amount of currency generated per block should be halved, making the process deflationary. Issuing currency with the creation of a new block in the ledger puts the power of the Mint in every hand of the network points.<br><br>
                    
                    The system aligns the incentives of all participants or "miners." Any miner who solved the puzzle and submitted to the labor test first could receive a sum of money. They have a motivation to ensure the long-term success of the platform by purchasing the best equipment to perform mining operations, expending energy as efficiently as possible and maintaining the reason book. So the miners compete with each other for the leadership of the consensus, from computational power to solve the puzzle (cryptographic challenge) and perform the work test.<br><br>
                    
                    The decision to start the development of validation systems by labor proof is given by the perception that there is happening a change in the matrix of data processing and these devices are the tool applied in this change. We knew about the challenge that we would face, because so far, our experience was limited to the development of systems for high frequency operations, as well as other developments, all using FPGAs.<br><br>
                    
                    We developed our Qu0701™ solution with ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) prototyping to achieve maximum performance in mining activity. The technical development was done together the world&#39;s largest foundry, which provides semiconductors to the largest technology companies, under a Non Disclosure Agreement. Our ASIC chip has an architecture with 7nm technology, which provides greater competitive advantage, guaranteeing maximum efficiency and very low power consumption. The device provides an output of 160 GH/s with TDP of 9.6W per chip. A thermal shut-off is integrated to prevent overheating and subsequent damage to the device.<br><br>

                <p class="wow fadeInRight animated">
                    
                    Asic Qu0701™ is powered by a power supply and integrates multiple hashing units that work in parallel. These units can be bypassed when malfunctioning inside the device. Also, this provides great modularity for system design. The communication between devices is done through an I2C interface operating at least 3.5 MHz and implements an auto addressing algorithm allowing flexibility in choice of device number on systems.<br><br>

                    <p class="wow fadeInRight animated">Our team works with software and hardware engineers, who together develop integrated solutions with the goal of delivering performance that only custom solutions can achieve. Our application includes the capacity to dynamically manage packet processing, taking advantage of hardware parallelism and adjusting the constant change of security algorithms. Each new generation of FPGA technologies, we use this experience and expertise to expand the boundaries and develop products with better performance, while maintaining the high level of reliability required in critical operations.<br><br>

                        In addition, reducing the delay between the arrival of market data and the issuance of an order is fundamental in high frequency negotiations and in these conditions all events are treated on the nanosecond scale, which is essentially impossible to obtain in software, of luck that having the best technology dedicated to such a scenario is critical to gaining a great competitive advantage in the form of latency arbitrage.<br><br>
                        
                        Our solution achieves extremely low latency operating in real and highly deterministic time. In practical terms, this means having the confidence and certainty of receiving the same latency in every business, regardless of market conditions. There is no oscillation in response time when we use our custom FPGA functionality, since hardware-based analysis does not use an operating system, besides that the process is dedicated to the operation that must be performed and is not subject to periodic interruptions by other system processes.<br><br>
